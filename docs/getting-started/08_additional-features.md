If you want to extend the functionality of your weather app, here are some ideas:
 
### Add a Loading Spinner
Display a spinner while the data is being fetched to improve user experience. This gives visual feedback that something is happening in the background.

### Show 5-day Forecast
Modify the API request to show a 5-day weather forecast instead of just the current weather. You can fetch this from the OpenWeatherMap API by changing the API endpoint.

### Allow Location Access
Use the browser’s Geolocation API to get the user’s current location and automatically show the weather for their area when they load the app.

### Add Themes (Light/Dark Mode)
Create a light and dark theme for your app, allowing users to switch between them. This can be done using CSS variables and a toggle button to switch the theme.

### Weather Icon Support
Display icons that represent the weather condition (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.). OpenWeatherMap provides icons for different weather conditions in their API response. You can dynamically load these into your app.

### Save Recent Searches
Store the user's recent city searches in the browser's localStorage and display them as suggestions when they return to the app. This enhances user convenience by allowing them to quickly check past cities' weather.

### Unit Conversion (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
Add a toggle switch to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Modify the API request by adjusting the units parameter to switch between metric and imperial units.

### Custom Background Based on Weather
Change the background of the app based on the weather condition (e.g., a sunny background for clear weather, a rainy one for wet conditions). This adds a visual element that enhances the app's immersion.

### Hourly Weather Updates
Implement hourly weather updates for the current day, using a different API endpoint to provide more detailed information. This could be displayed in a table or graph format.

### Responsive Design
Make sure your app works well on mobile devices by using responsive CSS techniques like flexbox or grid, and media queries to ensure proper scaling and layout on smaller screens.

### Weather Alerts
Include weather alerts for extreme weather conditions like storms, heatwaves, or floods. You can use OpenWeatherMap's One Call API to integrate weather alerts into your app.

### Internationalization
Add support for multiple languages in your app. You can either use the OpenWeatherMap API’s lang parameter to display weather descriptions in different languages, or build a localization system for the entire app interface.

### Weather Map Integration
Use a weather map service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap's weather layers) to allow users to view global weather patterns. This could be done by embedding an interactive map that shows real-time weather data across different regions.

### Display Sunrise and Sunset Times
Show users the sunrise and sunset times for the selected city. This can be fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API response and displayed under the weather information.

### Weekly Weather Summary
Add a feature that gives a brief summary of the weather conditions for the entire week (e.g., “Mostly sunny with some rain on Thursday”). This can be shown alongside the detailed forecast.
